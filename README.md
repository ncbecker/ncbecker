### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Nico, currently working as Junior Software Engineer in Cologne, Germany. My last big, personal project was [Podium](https://github.com/ncbecker/podium), my final project as a Web Development Trainee at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/). I am planning to rewrite Podium with TypeScript soon.
